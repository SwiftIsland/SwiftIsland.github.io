                    <p>When you buy a ticket you get it all - transport from Schiphol/Amsterdam to Den Helder, thats the place where the ferry takes you to Texel. A boat ticket. And we have a minivan that goes from the ferry to our location. Did we mention we have you covered for a round trip? We have found the perfect place to stay during our conference. Cabins. And best thing is - it's all included in the price!</p>

                    <p>You can buy a ticket and litereally leave your wallet at home. We've got you covered. Completely.</p>

                    <p>Did we mention we rented out an actual island in The Netherlands? (Ok, maybe not all of it but a small part).</p>

                    <p>It's called Texel (pronounced tes-sel) and itâ€™s one of the five Frisian Islands, located in the Wadden Sea, which is a <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1314" target="_blank">Unesco World Heritage</a>. In short - it's an island in the Netherlands and it's awesome.</p>

                    <p>Beyond the experience of being introduced to WWDC material by top-notch mentors on an frikkin' island<p>
