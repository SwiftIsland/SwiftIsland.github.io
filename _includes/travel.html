                    <p>While the island of Texel is pretty remote, getting there is quite easy and takes about 3 hours. From Schiphol Airport you can take a <a href="https://www.ns.nl/en/journeyplanner/#/?vertrek=Schiphol%20Airport&vertrektype=treinstation&aankomst=Den%20Helder&aankomsttype=treinstation&type=vertrek">train to Den Helder</a>, where the <a href="https://www.teso.nl/en/">ferry to Texel</a> departs. On Texel you can reach the venue by minivan service called <a href="https://texelhopper.nl/en/travel-information">Texelhopper</a>.</p>

                    <p>After extensive research and location scouting on the island itself we found the perfect spot to stay during our conference. <a href="https://www.prins-hendrik.nl/en/">Prins Hendrik Hotel and Bungalows</a>. (Also check out the photos below)<p>

                	<h3 class="section-title multiple-title">Getting around</h3>

                    <p>Like proper Dutchmen, the best way to get around on the island is by bike. We really recommend you add this to your ticket, because other means of transportation are sparse. Part of the Hassle-free™ deal is we make sure the bike is ready for you upon arrival. Do it, it’s fun!</p>

                    <h3 class="section-title multiple-title">Partners are welcome!</h3>

                    <p>You love your significant other, and so do we. They are more than welcome to join us! While you are having fun at the conference, getting all the new WWDC information in your brain, they can explore the island. There’s a special <i>Significant Other Ticket</i> for them, and we advise you to get them a bike as well.</p>
					<p>Do you want to also bring your kids? We can probably arrange that as well! Please contact us so we can figure something out for you.</p>
