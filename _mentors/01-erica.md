bio: "Erica Sadun writes lots of books. When not writing or coding, she parents geeks who are brushing up on their world domination skills. According to her academic dosimeter, she's acquired more education than any self-respecting person might consider wise. She enjoys deep diving into technology and has written, co-written, and contributed to dozens of books about computing and digital media. Sadun has blogged at TUAW, Ars Technica, O'Reilly, and Lifehacker. She has also authored more rejected Swift Language proposals than anyone else."
