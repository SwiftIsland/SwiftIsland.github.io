title: "Hassle-free travel - Plane ticket booking and bus times."
body: "If you are travelling from abroad it's best to book your plane ticket towards Schiphol Airport (AMS). If you are early you can wait in a lounge we reserved especially for Swift Island attendees and there will be a crew member waiting for you (more details will arrive in your mail after you book a ticket).<br><br>
From Schiphol we have a coach/bus waiting to take you to Texel where the conference is.<br>

<strong>The travel to Texel takes a while. We advise you to have your flight arrive at 14:00 the latest. Of Friday, you can expect to be back at Schiphol around 12:00</strong>
