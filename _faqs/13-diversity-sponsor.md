title: "Do you offer a diversity sponsorship?"
body: "We are committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity in the tech industry. From the first edition we have had a 50-50 men/women split for mentors. We recognize that underrepresented groups often face barriers to attending conferences and workshops, which is why we are proud to offer a diversity program to those who might not be able to attend Swift Island otherwise.<br/><br/>

Our diversity program provides discounted tickets to individuals from underrepresented groups, including but not limited to: women, people of color, individuals with disabilities, LGBTQIA+ people, and those from low-income backgrounds. If you are interested in applying for a diversity ticket for Swift Island, please <a href='mailto:info@swiftisland.nl'>send us an email</a> describing why you are applicable for a diversity ticket. We value your privacy and will keep all information confidential.<br/><br/>

<strong>Please note:</strong> <i>Our diversity program only offers conference attendance + Hassel-free travel from Schiphol Airport to Texel. If you live abroad getting to the Netherlands via train, plane or other forms of transportation is on your own account and is not covered by our diversity program.</i><br/><br/>

The deadline for submitting your diversity sponsorship is 30th of May 2024.
<br/><br/>

We have Diversity Sponsorship ❣️ tickets available to help facilitate this program. Would you like to contribute to promoting diversity in a simple way? <a href='https://ti.to/swiftisland/2024/with/diversity-sponsorship'>Purchase a sponsorship ticket now</a>!"
