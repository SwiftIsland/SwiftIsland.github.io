                <p>If your flight happens to arrive in the morning of the 2nd of July, you have two options: explore Amsterdam or wait at Schiphol. Right underneath the main hall at Schiphol is a train station, and trains towards Amsterdam Central depart regularly and only take 15 minutes. Be sure to be back in time though, because to be in time for the ferry to Texel, we can not let the bus wait for you.</p>
                <p>Not that adventurous or have some work to do? We've got you covered too. We have arranged with the Sheraton hotel right next to Schiphol, that you can wait and relax in their lounge. There is wifi, power outlets, and your first drink is on us.</p>
